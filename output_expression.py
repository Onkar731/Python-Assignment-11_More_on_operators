"""
What will be the output of the python expression 5>10<5?
"""

# evaluating expression and printing result
print(5>10<5)

"""
    result of the above expression will be "False" because in python it compares
    values individually not like c/c++
    First it check for -
    1. 5 > 10   => False
    2. 10 < 5   => False
    that's why the result is False
